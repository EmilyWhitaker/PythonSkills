    "General questions:\n",
    "What's the difference between `=` and `==`?\n",
    "    = is for variable assignment, == is for comparison\n",
    "    \n",
    "What is a boolean expression?\n",
    "    An expression that returns a binary \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    How are ints, floats, and strings compared in boolean expressions?\n",
    "        Ints and floats can be compared mathematically (<, >, ==, etc.). Strings are compared alphabetically (a < z)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    How are 'and', 'or', and 'not' considered in boolean expressions?\n",
    "        and: both/all parts of statement must be true to return TRUE\n",
    "        or: at least one of the statements must be true to return TRUE\n",
    "        not: returns the opposite of the evaluation of the statement\n",
    "        \n",
    "What does the % operator do?\n",
    "    Returns the remainder of two numbers divided. E.g. 4%3 returns 1. 25%5 returns 0. 12%5 returns 2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "What's the difference between a while loop and a for loop?\n",
    "    A while loop runs WHILE a condition is true.  A for loop runs \"for each item\" in a list, range, or other indexible type\n",
    "    \n",
    "What is the \"condition\" in a while loop?\n",
    "    The condition is what sets the number of iterations through the loop. It's often assigned as a vairable that is\n",
    "    incrememnted, or based on a boolean, causing the loop to run until the boolean's value flips\n",
    "    \n",
    "    How do you increment this condition?\n",
    "        If it is based on a variable counter (setting a variable to a value and creating a condition from that variable)\n",
    "        you can add to/subtract from/increment in some way the value of the variable each time through the loop\n",
    "        If it is based on a boolean, you can create a condition that, at the point you want it to happen, changes the\n",
    "        boolean's value\n",
    "        \n",
    "What is an \"iterator\" in a for loop?\n",
    "    the iterator (often set as variable i, if not named more descriptively based on circumstance) is a temporary\n",
    "    variable created that loops over the given set of values. E.g. \"i\" is the iterator in \"for i in range(10):\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    How is range() useful in a for loop?\n",
    "        Range() provides a temporary range of numbers over which the iterator loops. Useful as a way to tell a for loop\n",
    "        how many times to go through the loop.  Can be combined with the len() function to do the action performed\n",
    "        within the for loop the number of times that is the length of a list, string, array, etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Why is a for loop often much better to use than a while loop?\n",
    "    - while loops often require setting a global variable which is BAD practice. Takes up memory and can be inadvertently\n",
    "    overwritten or influence later parts of code, causing bugs.\n",
    "    - takes fewer lines, reducing runtime and making code look \"cleaner\"\n",
    "    - basing for loop iterator off or length of an object being looped over will keep the loop running the correct\n",
    "    number of times if the length of the object is changed.  Hard-coding a condition for a while loop will not.\n",
    "    \n",
    "How do \"if\", \"elif\", and \"else\" work?\n",
    "    when used in combination:\n",
    "    - if: if a condition is met, performed the following action\n",
    "    - elif: if a different condition is met, perform the following action\n",
    "    - else: if none of the above conditions are met, perform the following action\n",
    "    ** you can have unlimited elif statements following an if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: a useful skill to learn is \"stepping through\" code, particularly with loops. Before you \n",
    "run each cell, walk yourself mentally through each line of your code and say/write down what\n",
    "you think the final output will be.  If you get an error, what made the code run differently\n",
    "than you expected?\n",
